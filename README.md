# Report-Commenter

Small script I wrote for a Homeschooling that manuall creates all reports in MS Word. 

Teachers will fill in the mark and save the reports in a folder.

The python file will run and add comments for each subject based on the students mark.

A backup will be made beforehand in the event of anything going wrong
